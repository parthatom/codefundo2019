## Idea
* Instant-runoff voting system execution is difficult when done through EVMs. But by using blockchain technologies this can be implemented quickly and more efficiently.
* Display of live results. Enabling voters to change their votes any number of times. Every vote can be processed as a transaction. Hence with history of votes, the latest transaction, at the time of the deadline, can be used as the final vote.
* Live vote Display. Vote count display. Fake votes detected/destroyed display.
* SMS integrated voting, to increase reach.

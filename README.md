## Problems
* Transparency - Verification of each individual's vote count;
* Budget - A standard EVM costs around $3000.
* Geographical Issues - For voters from isolated regions, voting is a hassle for both the Election Commission and the voters themselves.
* Security - EVM hacking; Poll both influence; Duplicate voter identities; Impersonation;
* First-past-the-post voting system - Tactical Voting, Wasted votes, Gerrymandering, Smaller parties may reduce the success of the largest similar party.
* Only one voting attempt - irrespective of the reason, voters presently have only one attempt to make a vote.

## Idea
* Instant-runoff voting system execution is difficult when done through EVMs. But by using blockchain technologies this can be implemented quickly and more efficiently.
* Display of live results. Enabling voters to change their votes any number of times. Every vote can be processed as a transaction. Hence with history of votes, the latest transaction, at the time of the deadline, can be used as the final vote.
* Live vote Display. Vote count display. Fake votes detected/destroyed display.
* SMS integrated voting, to increase reach.
